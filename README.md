# Hackathon - ChatBot

## Interface

This project covers the interface portion of the ChatBot Hackathon project. The interface is where the user will hold conversations with the chatbot. It consists of two portions: a chat box for talking with the chatbot and a window for displaying the results of searches.

## Installation

At the moment, this project consists only of static web contant, so the user only requires a web browser. To view the interface, open `index.html` in browser.
